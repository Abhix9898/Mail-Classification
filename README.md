# Email-Spam-Classifier
Email spam, often referred to as junk email, is a persistent issue in the digital communication era. It involves unsolicited messages, often sent in bulk, that clutter inboxes and pose security risks to users. These messages can range from advertisements and phishing attempts to malware distribution. As email remains a critical tool for both personal and professional communication, effectively filtering and managing spam has become essential.

Email spam classification is the process of identifying and segregating spam messages from legitimate ones. This classification is typically achieved through machine learning techniques that analyze various features of the emails to determine their likelihood of being spam. The implementation of these techniques can significantly reduce the impact of spam on users, enhancing productivity and security.

In this Jupyter Notebook, we will delve into the process of building an email spam classifier. This journey will involve several key steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: We will start by acquiring a dataset of emails, which will include both spam and non-spam messages. Preprocessing steps will involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming text data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset. This includes visualizing the distribution of spam and non-spam emails, identifying common features of spam messages, and understanding the relationships between different variables.

Feature Extraction and Selection: Since emails are primarily text-based, we will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features. Techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF) will be employed. We will also explore selecting the most relevant features to improve the model's performance.

Model Building and Evaluation: Various machine learning models will be built and evaluated. These may include algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and more. We will train these models on the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Tuning and Optimization: We will fine-tune the models using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance their performance. This step ensures that our final model is both robust and efficient.
